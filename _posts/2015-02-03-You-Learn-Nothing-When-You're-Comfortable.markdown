### Over the past few months I've been trying to do things I never thought I would do.


Last week I gave a presentation to my class of ~50 people.  It wasn’t so bad. It was among my peers.  I was perceived as a student, so they treated me that way.


### It was way too comfortable, and I hated it.


I thought back to my first pitch ever, and how terribly I did, but more importantly, *how much I learned.*  So I thought to myself again, what could I never imagine myself doing?  The answer was teaching a class to over *three-hundred* people. Three days from now.


### My friend said I was visibly uneasy.


 I felt horrible before the class.  I was doubting myself, thoughts of canceling were creeping into my head.  I didn't know it at the time, but it was exactly what I wanted.



### And when the class was over, I felt amazing.


Isn't it funny how your emotions can do a complete 180 in just thirty minutes?  I felt fantastic.  Emails were pouring in asking me for a more advanced class.


### If you want to make a difference in this world, you need to be able to verbalize your thoughts.


One of the best mentors I’ve ever had is named Andrew Homeyer.  He once said if you want to make a difference in this world, you need to be able to verbalize your thoughts.  You need to be able to communicate your ideas physically in front of hundreds if not thousands of people.   I always knew this was true, but I never truly understood it until I gave this talk.
