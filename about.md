##**"** *To be a warrior is not a simple matter of wishing to be one. It is rather an endless struggle that will go on to the very last moment of our lives. Nobody is born a warrior, in exactly the same way that nobody is born an average man. We make ourselves into one or the other.* **"**

## Where I talk about me.

###*I'm a computer science and business student. I want to use my skill set to build something truly amazing with truly amazing people.*


####I went to the principals office more often than not when I was in middle school.
I didn't like being told what to do or how to do something, so I did things the way I wanted to.  It got me into some trouble, but I couldn't stand being told that there's one way to do something. I want to build value into people's lives and following a strict set of rules doesn't get you very far. 


####Outside of coding and startups...
I love improv comedy.  Come see one of our shows!
