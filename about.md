<h2>Where I talk about me.</h2>
<p>I went to the principals office more often than not when I was in middle school.  I didn't like being told what to do
  or how to do something, so I didn't listen.  I guess that's how I ended up wanting to work for myself, I get to make my own rules.  So I guess I'm what people call an "entrepreneur". Oh yeah, I'm also a student on the side.</p>

<h2>Where I Talk About the Stuff I do</h2>
<h1><b>Helping New Organic Foods Find a Home</b></h1>

<h1><b>Teaching Coding to High-Schoolers</b></h1>
  <p>Our world is moving fast, and schools are not effectively preparing students for the future.  Someone has to do something about it. We want to penetrate schools and integrate computer science into existing curriculums, but that's a few years down the road.  For now we're working on hosting hackathons for high schoolers.</p>
