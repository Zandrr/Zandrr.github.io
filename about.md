<h2>Where I talk about me.</h2>
<p>I went to the principals office more often than not when I was in middle school.  I didn't like being told what to do
  or how to do something, so I did things the way I wanted to.  It got me into some trouble, but I hated being told that there's one way to do something with no exceptions. I want to build value into people's lives and following a bunch of rules doesn't get you  very far. I'm a computer science and business student and I want to use my skill set to build something truly amazing with some truly amazing people. </p>

<h2>Where I Talk About the Stuff I do</h2>
<h1><b>Helping New Organic Foods Find a Home</b></h1>
  <p><a href="http://SproutGuild.com">SproutGuild</a> is a daily discovery of the hottest new natural foods, products and brands.  We want to help get awesome companies off the ground and into stores by exposing them to the world.</p>
<h1><b>Creating a Hub for Resources in Boulder</b></h1>

<h1><b>Helping Students get Awesome Internships</b></h1>
<p> If you wanna be a rockstar entrepreneur, you need experience.  We're working on <a href="http://Boulderstartups.org">Startups2Students</a>, a free service for students to find internships with local startups and for startups to find awesome interns.</p>
<h1><b>Helping Developers move <i>faster</i></b></h1>
  <p>At <a href="https://waffle.io">waffle</a> we're creating a way for developers to automatically move work using <a href="http://www.danielglunz.com/[%22github%22]/gitting-started/">github</a>. I'm an intern on the team, so specifically we're creating awesome graphs and metrics in order to improve productivity.</p>
<h1><b>Teaching Coding to High-Schoolers</b></h1>
  <p>Our world is moving fast, and schools are not effectively preparing students for the future.  Someone has to do something about it. We want to penetrate schools and integrate computer science into existing curriculums, but that's a few years down the road.  For now we're working on hosting hackathons for high schoolers.</p>
<h1><b>Putting on the Biggest Hackathon in Colorado</b></h1>
  <p>HackCU!  We are working on putting on a massive hackathon in collaboration with <a href="http://mlh.io">Major League Hackers</a>.  This is awesome because it helps students find internships, it helps companies find awesome developers, and it allows students to get started on that fitbit for dogs that they've always been dreaming of.</p>
