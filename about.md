### Where I talk about me.

*I'm a computer science and business person. I want to use my skill set to build something truly amazing with truly amazing people.  I'm currently a software engineering intern at Twitter.*

Let's get a beer and some delicious food. Seriously shoot me an email, I'm always down to talk about life.


## Projects - Not Code Stuff

### [Mailroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60lAmF7kcY0&app=desktop)

I was recently an actor in a friend's Amelie-like film.  It was awesome.


### [GitHub Teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmSYLfGIvrA&feature=youtu.be)

I've been teaching an introduction to GitHub class to some peeps at my school.


### [HackCU](http://hackcu.org)


The website isn't the cool part, the event is.  I co-founded it, I'm currently director of outreach.


### [Startups2Students](http://startups2students.hackcu.org)

Again, the event is pretty sweet.  You're not just a piece of paper.  Meet startups in person.  Be human.
