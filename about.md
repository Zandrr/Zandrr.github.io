### Where I talk about me.

*I'm a computer science and business student. I want to use my skill set to build something truly amazing with truly amazing people.*


I went to the principals office more often than not when I was in middle school.
I didn't like being told what to do or how to do something, so I did things the way I wanted to.  It got me into some trouble, but I couldn't stand being told how to do something. I want to build value into people's lives and following a strict set of rules won't get me very far.
