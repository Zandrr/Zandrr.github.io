##Where I talk about me.
***I'm a computer science and business student at the University of Colorado at Boulder. I want to use my skill set to build something truly amazing with truly amazing people.*** I went to the principals office more often than not when I was in middle school.  I didn't like being told what to do or how to do something, so I did things the way I wanted to.  It got me into some trouble, but I hated being told that there's one way to do something with no exceptions. I want to build value into people's lives and following a bunch of rules doesn't get you  very far. 

###Where I Talk About the Stuff I do


####**Helping New Organic Foods Find a Home** <br> *February 2014 - October 2014*
**[SproutGuild]("http://SproutGuild.com")** is a daily discovery of the hottest new natural foods, products and brands.  We want to help get awesome companies off the ground and into stores by exposing them to the world. 


#####*How I was involved:*
I was one of the two lead developers/designers on this project.  We built it using metoer.js!


####**Creating a Hub for Entrepreneurial Resources in Boulder** <br> *December 2013 - December 2014*
**[BoulderStartups]("http://Boulderstartups.org")** is a home for entrepreneurial resources.  From space to legal help to  funding, we've created a one-stop-shop for entrepreneurs in Boulder (old and new) to find what they need for their next venture.


#####*How I was involved:*
I am the lead developer and designer, built in ruby on rails!


####**Putting on the Biggest Hackathon in Colorado** <br> *September 2014 - Present*
**[HackCU!]("http://hackcu.org")**  We are working on putting on a massive hackathon in collaboration with Major League Hackers.  We want to help students find internships, help companies find awesome developers, and allow students to get started on that fitbit for dogs that they've always been dreaming of.


#####*How I am involved:*
I am the lead site designer.  I also raise money.  Oh and I deal with relations between the university and the venture.  The whole team does whatever it takes to make it happen.


####**Working in the *Next Generation Networks* Lab at CU Boulder** <br> *September 2014 - Present*
**[Our project](https://github.com/kaoudis/phonebook.js)** led by [Kelly Kaoudis](https://csel.cs.colorado.edu/~kaoudis/) is an anonymous file transfer system using the onion protocol.


#####*How I am involved:*
I am the lead front end developer.  I am also using Node.js to assist in building out the backend of the application.



####**Teaching Git and GitHub to Introductory Computer Science Students** <br> *December 2014 - Present*
**[Part time teacher.](https://speakerdeck.com/zandrr)** I believe that learning git and github early in a software engineer's career is vital to their success in both school and industry.  My university does not formally teach the tools, yet they expect students to effectively use them. This is pretty backwards if you ask me.  Thus I have been teaching git and github to classes from 50 to 250 students.

#####*How I am involved:*
I develop and implement entire lesson plans based on skill level!


####**User Experience Design Researcher at Edify Technologies** <br> *December 2014 - Present*
The good people at **[Edify Technologies](http://www.sketchasong.com/#/)** are working on creating the greatest music education experience that they can by developing a suite of applications aimed at children ages 6-10!



#####*How I am involved:*
I'm one of two user experience design researchers.  My job is to meet with as many parents, music teachers, and kids as I possibly can in order to gain insights into how to improve user experience.
