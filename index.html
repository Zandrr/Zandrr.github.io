                  <h1>Simply Intuitive</h1>
                 <p>When a user sees it, they know exactly how to use it. The moment the user arrives at a website, they should know what they have the ability to do, and how to get there.  It should afford a few simple features that are well signified.  Imagine you are in a restaurant, and you go to use the bathroom.  When you arrive, there’s no handle!  This is an example of non-intuitive design – it removes focus from the users task, in this case, to use the bathroom. Our user should not need to stop and think about how to get to where they need to be.  According to Krug, author of “Don’t Make me Think” – a guide to web usability, the web page should be obvious and self-explanatory. As a web designer, your job is to get rid of the question marks; no one likes to be confused.  If your architecture is not intuitive, the number of question marks grows, and the user’s ability to get from point A to point B diminishes.</p>

                 <p style="padding-top: 10px" >In the case of the museum website, the first items my eye goes to are the three links in the top left corner.  The “F-pattern” describes the way in which user’s read web content, two horizontal stripes, followed by a vertical stripe. This site in particular utilizes this idea well.  All of the clickable links fall into this F-shaped pattern, allowing the user to easily navigate to where they need to go.  Within two seconds of looking at the website I know that I have three main options:  I can plan my visit, view the collection, and read more about the museum.  That’s it.  The user is relinquished of his or her duty to decide what to do, the website effectively tells you what you can do.  The key here is to allow the user to interact quickly and effectively with the architecture you’ve provided.  The user’s number of question marks should be zero.</p>

                 <p style="padding-top: 10px" >Although, this idea of intuitiveness on a website is quite subjective.  Let’s assume that you, the designer, are a rational person.  You want people to navigate your site with ease; you want it to be intuitive.  Easier said than done, even the webpage you’re on right now may not be intuitive to you, but it is intuitive to me.  A design itself is not intuitive, it’s whether each individual user feels that it is intuitive.  So how do we effectively design a website to be as intuitive as it can be?  The answer is we need to build based on our audience.  If your audience were tech savvy programmers you would design it completely differently if your target were grandmas looking to send birthday cards to their grandchildren.  This is challenging if your target audience is tech savvy nerds, grandmas, and everything in between.  There is a huge range of people visiting your site.   We can call this the knowledge gap: the difference in knowledge coming into the site, and ability to do what the user needs to do.  The narrower your audience, the easier it is to design for.  The solution?  TEST, TEST, TEST.  Are your links being clicked?  How long do people spend on each page?  An intuitive webpage is difficult because of it’s subjectivity, but it is possible to achieve.</p>
