        <title>You Learn Nothing When You&#39;re comfortable</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;over-the-past-few-months-ive-been-trying-to-do-things-i-never-thought-i-would-do&quot;&gt;Over the past few months I’ve been trying to do things I never thought I would do.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I didn’t love school.  By &lt;em&gt;‘didn’t love school’&lt;/em&gt; I mean that I hated it.  I would fake sick 2-3 times a week. I thought my parents would believe me.  Every time.   So naturally, I never thought I would become school…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I gave a presentation to my class of ~50 people.  It wasn’t so bad. It was among my peers.  I was perceived as a student, so they treated me that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-was-way-too-comfortable-and-i-hated-it&quot;&gt;It was way too comfortable, and I hated it.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought back to my first pitch ever, and how terribly I did, but more importantly, &lt;em&gt;how much I learned.&lt;/em&gt;  So I thought to myself again, what could I never imagine myself doing?  The answer was teaching a class to over &lt;em&gt;three-hundred&lt;/em&gt; people. Three days from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-friend-said-i-was-visibally-uneasy&quot;&gt;My friend said I was visibally uneasy.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt horrible before the class.  I was doubting myself, thoughts of canceling were creeping into my head.  I didn’t know it at the time, but it was exactly what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-when-the-class-was-over-i-felt-amazing&quot;&gt;And when the class was over, I felt amazing.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it funny how your emotions can do a complete 180 in just thirty minutes?  I felt fantastic, and I remember my friend commenting on how different I was acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-you-want-to-make-a-difference-in-this-world-you-need-to-be-able-to-verbalize-your-thoughts&quot;&gt;If you want to make a difference in this world, you need to be able to verbalize your thoughts.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best mentors I’ve ever had is named Andrew Homeyer.  He once said if you want to make a difference in this world, you need to be able to verbalize your thoughts.  You need to be able to communicate your ideas physically in front of hundreds if not thousands of people.   I always knew this was true, but I never truly understood it I gave this talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;check-it-out&quot;&gt;Check it out:&lt;/h3&gt;

        <title>Failing with Confidence</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-bombed-a-pitch&quot;&gt;I bombed a pitch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago was my first time pitching in front of an audience. I was terrified that I would &lt;em&gt;fail&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
So I did.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When my team was called, I went up, spouted some bullshit, and finished with the oh so classic line: “&lt;em&gt;That was terrible…&lt;/em&gt;” Goddamn, I’m suave.  At that moment every ounce of confidence that I had built over the years was ripped away from me.  I felt stupid.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yet-the-confidence-surged-back&quot;&gt;Yet the confidence surged back&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed up with: “Guys it’s much better when I remember it.”  The chuckles were  weirdly envigorating.  One of the judges said: “So, I have no idea what the hell you’re doing.” I responded with a flawless pitch, it was exactly what I wanted to say.  The words flowed out of me like something that flows, I don’t know, a babbling brook or something. The point is I pitched it.  I pitched it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-i-learned-that-i-should-use-my-fucking-brain&quot;&gt;And I learned that I should use my fucking brain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of regurgitating a script, think. Remember a few key points, and then say what you know.  Unless you’re into mindless babbling. In that case, memorize it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-that-no-matter-how-badly-you-fuck-up-its-probably-salvagable&quot;&gt;And that no matter how badly you fuck up, it’s probably salvagable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have just sat down and wallowed in my own pity, but I didn’t.  I stood there feeling like an idiot and fixed it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There will be failure, that’s unavoidable.  It’s what you do in the face of failure that defines who you are.  If you’re not willing to fail, you’ll never learn.  If you fail with confidence, you’ll emerge even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; confident. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;
