  <h2 id="where-i-talk-about-me">Where I talk about me.</h2>
<p><strong><em>I’m a computer science and business student at the University of Colorado at Boulder. I want to use my skill set to build something truly amazing with truly amazing people.</em></strong> I went to the principals office more often than not when I was in middle school.  I didn’t like being told what to do or how to do something, so I did things the way I wanted to.  It got me into some trouble, but I hated being told that there’s one way to do something with no exceptions. I want to build value into people’s lives and following a bunch of rules doesn’t get you  very far. </p>

<p><strong><a href="&quot;http://Boulderstartups.org&quot;">BoulderStartups</a></strong> is a home for entrepreneurial resources.  From space to legal help to  funding, we’ve created a one-stop-shop for entrepreneurs in Boulder (old and new) to find what they need for their next venture.</p>

<h5 id="how-i-was-involved-1"><em>How I was involved:</em></h5>
<p>I am the lead developer and designer, built in ruby on rails!</p>

<p><strong><a href="&quot;http://hackcu.org&quot;">HackCU!</a></strong>  We are working on putting on a massive hackathon in collaboration with Major League Hackers.  We want to help students find internships, help companies find awesome developers, and allow students to get started on that fitbit for dogs that they’ve always been dreaming of.</p>

<h5 id="how-i-am-involved"><em>How I am involved:</em></h5>
<p>I am the lead site designer.  I also raise money.  Oh and I deal with relations between the university and the venture.  The whole team does whatever it takes to make it happen.</p>

<h4 id="teaching-git-and-github-to-introductory-computer-science-students-br-december-2014---present"><strong>Teaching Git and GitHub to Introductory Computer Science Students</strong> <br /> <em>December 2014 - Present</em></h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/zandrr">Part time teacher.</a></strong> I believe that learning git and github early in a software engineer’s career is vital to their success in both school and industry.  My university does not formally teach the tools, yet they expect students to effectively use them. This is pretty backwards if you ask me.  Thus I have been teaching git and github to classes from 50 to 250 students.</p>

<h5 id="how-i-am-involved-2"><em>How I am involved:</em></h5>
<p>I develop and implement entire lesson plans based on skill level!</p>

<h5 id="how-i-am-involved-3"><em>How I am involved:</em></h5>
<p>I’m one of two user experience design researchers.  My job is to meet with as many parents, music teachers, and kids as I possibly can in order to gain insights into how to improve user experience.  </p>
